| Addition | x + y, a + b + c |
| Subtraction | x - y, a - b - c |
| Multiplication | x * y, a * b * c |
| Division | x / y. a / b / c |
| Modulus | x % y |
| Less than | x < y |
| Greater than | x > y|
| Equal to? | x == y |
| Less than or equal to | x <= y |
| Greater than or equal to | x >= y |
| Not equal to | x != y |
